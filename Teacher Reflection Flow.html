                    "3": "You’re creating space for student voice—a solid start! To move forward, reflect on the last two lessons: Did student questions mostly lead to deeper learning, or were they about clarifying instructions? What type of question or activity gets them **most engaged**?",
                    "4_5": "Wonderful! Encouraging students to ask questions and explain their thinking is at the heart of CBE. To expand this, how could you start having students **critique their own work or their peers’ work** based on a specific success criterion?",

                    "3": "Good! You sometimes include application. The next step is making it a habit. Could you identify one lesson next week where you will replace a **recall question with an application task**? For example, instead of ‘What is a square?’, ask ‘Find two square objects in this room.’",
                    "4_5": "Excellent! You focus on application, which builds real understanding. To push this further, think about **community connections**. What is one additional real-life or local connection you could use to make the concept relevant to their home life or neighborhood?",

                    "3": "Good! You sometimes use feedback. Try to formalize this process. Could you dedicate 5 minutes after each lesson to note **one key observation** (a common mistake or a success story) that will *directly* guide your planning for the following day?",
                    "4_5": "Fantastic! You are responsive to student learning. How could you take this further—perhaps by planning a **small follow-up activity** during the next class that explicitly targets the single, most common misconception you observed?",

                    "4_5": "Excellent! You focus on making learning relevant. To deepen this, how could you make the theme even more relevant by **inviting a community member** (like a local farmer or artisan) to briefly share their knowledge, linking the curriculum directly to local wisdom?",
